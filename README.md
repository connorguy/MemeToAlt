# MemeToAlt
#### Self contained alt text generator for memes
#### In depth post [here](https://medium.com/@connor-guy/creating-meme-alt-text-using-image-classification-and-nlp-56ea3d7b70e5)

## Using Streamlit
You can run a [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) ui version of this via `streamlit run main.py`

Or a demo version is live [here](https://share.streamlit.io/connorguy/altmemedemo/main/main.py).

## Command Line
Running via the command line is possible by just running `python3 main.py`. A defualt url is used in this case and can be changed via the `demo_meme` var.
